📦 KurdNet – Kurdish Handwritten Character & Digit Recognition (Open-Source OCR)

KurdNet is an open-source deep learning system designed to recognize Kurdish handwritten characters and digits.
The model supports 35 Kurdish alphabet letters and 10 numerical digits (0–9) and is built using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for lightweight deployment.

KurdNet provides a full OCR pipeline, including:

🔍 Image preprocessing

✂️ Segmentation

🧠 CNN-based classification

📤 Web and mobile integration

📚 Dataset loading utilities

This project aims to support Kurdish language technology, academic research, educational applications, and document digitization systems.
